            Hi, I'm Stephen.  I'm pursuing a Computer Science major with a minor in Mathematics and a certificate in
            German. That's a mouthful. Anyways, besides being in school, I play video games (currently working my way 
            through Persona 3 Reloaded), play the drums, write short-stories here and there, and do one off things with friends 
            like climbing and skiing. <br>
